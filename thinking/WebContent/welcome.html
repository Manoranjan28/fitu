            The code, documentation and examples here are the result of hard work. This is my only job. You can keep this project going by

            Most of the examples have been extracted directly from <a href="#">my blog</a>. All paths in the examples
            have been converted to map directly to paths in the yui-ext download. This will be the same structure of all examples going forward.
            No more searching through blog code to figure out how something was done!<br /><br />
            
            <b>Common Problems</b>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>To view the HTML source of an example, right click (Mac users control+click) in the body of the
                       example and select "View Source" or "This Frame"-&gt;"View Source".</li>
                <li>Some examples take up a lot of screen space. You can right click and "Open in a new tab" or
                    "Open in a new Window" on the link to an example to see it in a full window.</li>
